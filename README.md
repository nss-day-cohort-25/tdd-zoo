C25 TDD class exercise

We will need to make 6 animals and assign them to one of 3 habitats
For example, a Bird class would inherit from Animal and have a nest attribute that is an instance of a Habitat.

This is a TDD-based project.
1 student will make an Animal superclass class
6 students will each make one subclass of Animal
1 student will make the Habitat class
3 students will each make a subclass of Habitat

Students making an animals subclass need
a) Animal and b) Habitat classes to
a) inherit from and b) compose into the class as self.habitat
